# CodSoft AI Internship - Task 1: Rule-Based Chatbot

## Project Overview

This project implements a simple rule-based chatbot as part of the CodSoft Artificial Intelligence Internship. The chatbot is designed to respond to user inputs based on predefined rules, demonstrating a basic understanding of natural language processing and conversation flow.

## Features

- **Interactive Conversation:** Takes user input and provides appropriate responses based on keywords.
- **Rule-Based Responses:** Uses `if-elif-else` statements to match user queries with predefined answers.
- **Basic Greetings & Farewell:** Handles "hello," "hi," and "bye."
- **Common Queries:** Responds to "how are you" and "name."
- **Help Functionality:** Offers a general "help" response.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Clearly identifies the bot's name ("RuleBot ðŸ¤–") and prompts the user.
- **Case-Insensitive Input:** Converts user input to lowercase for easier matching.

## How to Run

1.  **Prerequisites:**

    - Python 3.x installed (Download from: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/))

2.  **Clone the Repository:**

    - (You'll fill this part out after you upload to GitHub in the next step. It will look something like: `git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/CODSOFT_AI_Internship.git`)
    - For now, just make sure you have the `chatbot.py` file inside a folder named `CODSOFT_CHATBOT`.

3.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd CODSOFT_CHATBOT
    ```

4.  **Run the chatbot:**
    ```bash
    python chatbot.py
    ```

## Code Structure

- `chatbot.py`: Contains the main Python script for the rule-based chatbot, defining all the interaction logic and responses.
- `README.md`: This file, providing project information and instructions.

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Expand the knowledge base with more rules and responses.
- Implement more sophisticated pattern matching using regular expressions.
- Add a simple history to remember previous turns in the conversation.
- Integrate a basic Natural Language Understanding (NLU) library for better intent recognition.
