# CodSoft AI Internship - Task 2: Tic-Tac-Toe AI

## Project Overview

This project implements the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe, allowing a human player to play against an AI opponent. As part of the CodSoft Artificial Intelligence Internship, the goal is to develop an AI agent that can make strategic moves, aiming to be unbeatable.

## Features

- **Human vs. AI Gameplay:** Play against a computer AI opponent.
- **Game Board Display:** A simple text-based display of the Tic-Tac-Toe board.
- **Player Input:** Allows the human player to choose their moves.
- **Win/Draw Condition Check:** Determines if the game has ended in a win or a draw.
- **AI Opponent:** (Will be implemented using search algorithms like Minimax to make optimal moves.)

## How to Run

1.  **Prerequisites:**

    - Python 3.x installed (Download from: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/))

2.  **Clone the Repository (or download the files):**

    - (You will update this section after you push this project to your `Codsoft_AI_Tasks` GitHub repository. For now, this project should be in your local `CODSOFT_TIC_TAC_TOE` folder.)
    - `git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/Codsoft_AI_Tasks.git`
    - Then, navigate to the `CODSOFT_TIC_TAC_TOE` sub-folder.

3.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd CODSOFT_TIC_TAC_TOE
    ```

4.  **Run the game:**
    ```bash
    python tic_tac_toe.py
    ```

## Code Structure

- `tic_tac_toe.py`: Contains the main game logic, including the board representation, player moves, win condition checks, and the AI implementation.
- `README.md`: This file, providing project information and instructions.

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Implement the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning for a more efficient AI.
- Add a graphical user interface (GUI) instead of a text-based one.
- Allow two human players to play.
- Add error handling for invalid user inputs.
